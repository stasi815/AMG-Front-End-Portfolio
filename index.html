                            <p>
                                I am an enthusiastic people-person with excellent technical skills and a robust body of projects. I am an adaptable person who is not afraid of taking ownership of a project and meeting the requirements of the projectâ€™s specifications. Detail-oriented, I make sure to always add an extra effort in order to make my projects uniquely personal. I strongly value sustainability, corporate accountability, and community. I see a bright future for humanity, one where we learn to put all of our resources and technology toward providing a better quality of life for all people, especially those who suffer with poverty, hunger and a lack of social services. It is this future that I am interested in collaboratively working to create.
                            </p>
